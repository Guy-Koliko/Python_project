# **<ins>THE PYTHON OBJECT ORINENTED PROJECT</ins>**

This is just my small python project book.
In my struggles to become a software engineer, I decided to create this small
project book to help me be and stay on track.
On the _14th of January_ **_2020_**,i decided to become a full python 
developer so I started this project.
I have to build at least one project a day.
