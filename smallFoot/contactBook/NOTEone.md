# **THE CONTACT BOOK**

`The contact book is for keeping  records of contacts of all elements.
For smallfoot, contact has been separated from the from the address book because we see a contact
as a different entity. A persons contacts can be known but his his address can't be known hence the
difference.
When you find the contact of an element you can linked it to the address of that element.`
