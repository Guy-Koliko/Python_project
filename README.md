# THE PYTHON PROJECT BOOK #
* **
This is my personal python project library that I have decided to build upon.
I don't know how it is going to help someone but I know it will do something good someday.
Feel free fork the repo, contribute to this project. Together I know we will
be of help to some dude.
From this day I have decided to write at least a single python program a day to solve a problem.
I am not good nor perfect so please don't judge me.
Being out from job and being jobless has pushed me to dedicate my time for this.
**Critic's** are _welcome_

**Note ->** Please do your best to reference me when you use any of the codes here.
